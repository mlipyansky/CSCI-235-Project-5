/**
 * @file StationManager.hpp
 * @brief This file contains the declaration of the StationManager class, which manages a collection of kitchen stations in a virtual bistro simulation.
 *
 * The StationManager class includes methods to add, remove, and find stations, assign dishes to stations, replenish ingredients, and prepare dishes.
 * It also provides functionality to merge stations, move a station to the front of the list, and check if an order can be completed.
